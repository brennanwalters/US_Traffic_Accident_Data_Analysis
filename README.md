## Introduction

This was a collaborative project for a data scince course. The repository for the full project can be found [here](https://github.com/jdbanta/DS202_Final_Project).

The [data](https://www-fars.nhtsa.dot.gov/Trends/TrendsGeneral.aspx) was taken from The United States National Highway Traffic Safety Aministration website which reports statistics on fatal crashes as part of the Fatality Analysis Reporting System. This dataset is broken into many different tables making it easy to download the . This dataset is updated yearly to continue informing the US public. At the time of this analysis, data from years 1994 to 2017 was available.

## My Analysis
For my contribution to the project, I downloaded and cleaned data relating to the demographics of the traffic accident data and used it to perform visual analysis of the demographics involved in these accidents. I wanted to know more about the people who lost their lives to these crashes.

## Gender

We see that, over this time period, the number of male fatalities was more than double the number of female fatalities. This result was somewhat surprising to me and I wondered why that was the case. According to this [article](https://www.iihs.org/topics/fatality-statistics/detail/males-and-females) by The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS), this is due to the fact that men typically drive more miles than women and are more likely to exhibit risky driving behavior (e.g. not using seatbelts, drunk driving, speeding, etc.). The article states that "crashes involving male drivers often are more severe than those involving female drivers. However, females are more likely than males to be killed or injured in crashes of equal severity, although sex differences in fatality risk diminish with age."
